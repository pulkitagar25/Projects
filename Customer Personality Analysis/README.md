## Customer Personality Analysis

# Problem Statement
Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

Conclusions:
# Cluster 1:
- People with less expenses

- people who are married and parents of more than 3 kids

- people which low income

# Cluster 2:
- people with more expenses

- people who are single or parents who have less than 3 kids

- people with high income

- Age is not the criteria but it is observed to some extent that people who are older fall in this group

## So, the customers falling in cluster 2 likes to spend more...so the Firm's can target people falling in cluster 2 for the sale of their Products....
