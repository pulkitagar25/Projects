Predicted whether the transaction is fraudulent or not fraudulent with the random forest as a final model of accuracy of 97%.
According to this model, the predicted value we got, matches with the actual target values. We can see that in confusion matrix.

We have performed EDA, preprocessing, build different models, visualized feature importance, hyper parameter tunning and did prediction.

We also perform necessary operations to handle imbalanced and skewed nature of data.

'ERC20 uniq rec token name' and 'time diff between first and last (min)' these two are most important feature.![download](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65941848/183500018-631e669f-7be6-4bef-8038-3dcd21e83f98.png)
