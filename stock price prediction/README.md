It will be considering the Apple stocks data and will create a LSTM network for prediction. Here we split the data in
train and test, having it Apple share prices with open, high, low, close values for a particular day. Using this data in
our LSTM model we will predict the open prices for next 30 days.![Screenshot 2022-08-09 013229](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65941848/183504260-d72c59f6-ec4b-4913-9b4c-3c0301267408.jpg)


Also, tried to predicted the stock price with different regression algorithms.![Screenshot 2022-08-09 013152](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65941848/183504285-e650ad22-de15-461f-b8fb-453d45dc76f7.jpg)
